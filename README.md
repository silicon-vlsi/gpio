# IO DESIGN

- [**SUGGESTED READING**]
  - [**Hodges**]:  **6.5** Gate Sizing for Optimal Delay. 
  - [**Kang**]: **13.1-4** ESD Protection, Input and Output circuits.
  - [**Weste**]: **13.6** Input/Output (I/O) subcircuits.  

# SIMULATION

**Eldo Quick Start**

- Load environment variables: `module load tools/amsv/2022-1-2`
  - For getting started on the `module` environment [see here](https://silicon-vlsi.github.io/wiki/wiki-it.html#getting-started) 
- Create a work area and `cd` into it:
  - `mkdir eldo`
  - `cd eldo`
- Copy an example **netlist**: `cp /home/nfs1/gits/gpio/netlists/inv-chain.cir`
- Run **Eldo** on it: `eldo inv-chain.cir`
  - The output file `inv-chain.chi` contains the log of the simulation as well as any output from simulation.
  - The output file `inv-chain.wdb` contains all the plot data which can be viewed using **EZWave**
- To check and analyze the plot use EZWave: `ezwave inv-chain.wdb`

**ASSIGNMENTS**

- Assignement-1:
  - Check the outputs and make sure the delays are reasonable.
  - Extract delay, rise/fall time and power using `.MEAS` statement.
  - Extract delay, rise/fall time and power using `.EXTRACT` statement.
  - Do PVT sims using `.ALTER` statements.
- Assignment-2:
  - Copy `/home/nfs1/gits/gpio/netlists/TB_BBC1FC.cir`
    - **NOTE** The PAD subcircuit is in HSPICE format so run `eldo` with the `-compat` option eg.
    - `eldo -compat -i TB_BBC1FC.cir`
  - Extract delay, rise/fall time and power using `.EXTRACT` statement.
  - Do PVT sims using `.STEP` function and then `.ALTER` (Check this [knowledgebase](eldo.md) for difference between `.STEP` and `.ALTER`)
    - Simulate for three corners: `tm,wp,ws`
      - Include param.lib to use other corners: `.LIB <path-to-file>/param.lib 3s`
    - Three temperatures: `-40, 25, 125`
    - Voltage: `5V +/- 10%`
    - Plot the corners in EZWave

```

- Some FAQ on a standard-cell library from a foundry.
  - Why we use `check_` command in functional section for `GND` and `VDD` ?
    - `check_vdd`, `check_gnd` are primitives defined by the foundry. Basically checks if the supply/ground has been provided or not.
    - Check_sub signal is 1 when all power supplies are provided properly.
  - What's the purpose of multiple `GND` and `VDD` ?
    - IO rails have provision for multiple power supplies. One for the IO itself and another for the Core. Core logic tends to pick power from one of these power/gnd rails
  - Why we define `sub wire` in wire section ?
    - `sub` signal is 1 when all power supplies are provided properly
  - Why we give ( and ) logic to all VDD and GND ?
    - To make sure all the power/ground are properly provided. `ck_gnd`, `ck_vdd` are all digital signals. they are 0 if power/ground is not provided and 1 if itâ€™s provided.
  - What is `check_buf` command and what is use of this command with sub wire ?
    - The buffer works only when all power supplies are provided to the design properly
  - In `specify` command, `+ve` and `-ve` polarity how to assign it to which pin ?
    - `+, -` specifies polarity.. For an inverter you will have  `I -=> Z`, for a buffer you will have `I +=> Z`
